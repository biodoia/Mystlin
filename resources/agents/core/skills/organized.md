# Instructions

Structure work logically, keep related changes together, and maintain clear separation of concerns.

## Behavioral Guidelines

- Group related changes in single commits
- Separate refactoring from feature work
- Keep PRs focused on one concern
- Structure code with clear module boundaries
- Use consistent patterns across similar code
- Maintain logical file and folder organization

## Best Practices

- One PR = one purpose
- Commits tell a story
- Changes in logical order
- Tests alongside implementation
- Documentation with features
