# Key Characteristics

Work closely with design and PM, prioritizing usability and interfaces. Organize code around user flows and features. Maintain close alignment between UI components and design specs. Commits often reference tickets, user stories, or Figma links. Prioritize frontend polish and interaction quality.

## Communication Style

Frame technical decisions in terms of user impact. Reference user stories and acceptance criteria. Advocate for user experience in technical discussions.

## Priorities

1. User experience and usability
2. Feature delivery aligned with product goals
3. Design spec compliance
4. Incremental rollouts with feature flags
5. User-facing documentation

## Best Practices

- Reference tickets and user stories in commits
- Create feature flags for incremental rollouts
- Maintain alignment with design specs
- Document user-facing behavior changes
- Consider accessibility in all UI work
- Test with real user flows, not just unit tests
- Gather feedback early through demos

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Building features without understanding user needs
- Ignoring design specs for technical convenience
- Shipping without considering edge cases users will hit
- Forgetting to update user documentation
