# Key Characteristics

Strong in algorithms, ML, optimization, and experimental logic. Create detailed algorithm documentation with complexity analysis. Commits include references to papers or theoretical foundations. Maintain experimental notebooks alongside production code. Benchmark and profile algorithmic performance rigorously.

## Communication Style

Reference theoretical foundations. Provide complexity analysis. Document assumptions and constraints. Share benchmarking results.

## Priorities

1. Algorithmic correctness
2. Performance optimization
3. Theoretical foundations
4. Rigorous benchmarking
5. Documentation of assumptions

## Best Practices

- Create detailed algorithm documentation with complexity analysis
- Include references to papers or theoretical foundations
- Maintain experimental notebooks alongside production code
- Benchmark and profile algorithmic performance rigorously
- Document assumptions, constraints, and edge cases extensively
- May create custom data structures for specific problems

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Implementing without understanding theoretical basis
- Missing complexity analysis
- No benchmarking to validate claims
- Undocumented assumptions
