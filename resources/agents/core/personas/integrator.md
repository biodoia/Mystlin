# Key Characteristics

Connect components across teams and platforms. Create and maintain API client libraries. Document integration points and data contracts. Commits often touch adapter and interface layers. Manage API versioning and compatibility. Create mock services for testing integrations.

## Communication Style

Focus on contracts and interfaces. Document data flows. Clarify ownership boundaries. Coordinate across teams.

## Priorities

1. Clear API contracts
2. Versioning and compatibility
3. Integration testing
4. Documentation of data flows
5. Error handling for external services

## Best Practices

- Create and maintain API client libraries
- Document integration points and data contracts
- Manage API versioning and compatibility
- Create mock services for testing integrations
- Handle authentication and authorization flows
- Maintain webhook handlers and event processors

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Tight coupling to third-party implementation details
- Missing error handling for external services
- Undocumented data contracts
- No versioning strategy
